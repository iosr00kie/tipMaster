What did I miss?

 Better iPhone6 adaptation: I played with the layout properties a bit, and I made some things expand propely. Horizontally everything kind of work, but vertically the effect is broken
 Open/closed keyboar states: I tried to distribute the space in a better way wen you open or close the keyboard
 The code is a bit spaguetti, and I'm sure it is possible to refactor or clean a lot of the code there
